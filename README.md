Then you have two methods to use the emote: 
1) a combo of applymovement and msgbox, the good ol'method

          A bit long isn't it? lets see method 2
2) Using the macro added by me in this Branch! its called msgboxEmote, and you can insert the values for the applymovement and msgbox directly here!

WOAH! Already done!
For the first parameter you pass the id, the second one is the movement and the third one is the text!
